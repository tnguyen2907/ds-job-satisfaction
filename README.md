# Data Science for Job Satisfaction

This project examines the relationship between company attributes and job satisfaction, using company ratings as an indicator of employee satisfaction. The analysis is based on a dataset created by merging [LinkedIn Job Postings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/data) and [AmbitionBox Company Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nagrajdesai/company-reviews-and-ratings-from-ambitionbox). The methodology includes:  

- **Data Visualization**: To identify trends and patterns.  
- **Regression Modeling**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Lasso regression to evaluate predictors of job satisfaction.  
- **Clustering**: To group companies based on shared characteristics.  

Detailed methods and results are available in the [final paper](https://github.com/tnguyen2907/ds-job-satisfaction/blob/main/final_paper.pdf).
